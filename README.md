## 📖 About The Project

**Sentience Sandbox** is an experimental simulation environment designed to observe the long-term behaviors of autonomous AI agents. Unlike standard chatbots, these agents possess:
*   **Persistent Memory:** They remember interactions from days or weeks ago.
*   **Psychological Profiles:** Unique personality traits based on the "Big Five" model.
*   **Maslowian Needs:** Internal drives for hunger, social interaction, and self-actualization.

The world runs on a 2D top-down web canvas. As a player, you act as an **Observer/Deity**. You can watch societies form, economies emerge, and relationships crumble—or you can intervene using "God Tools" to alter the environment and whisper thoughts into agents' minds.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 The Agents (The "Soul")
*   **Big Five Personality Engine:** Every agent has randomized stats (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) that filter their perception of reality.
*   **Vector-Based Memory:** Agents utilize a vector database (RAG) to store and retrieve memories, allowing for grudges, friendships, and complex relationship histories.
*   **Reflection Loops:** Agents "sleep" to process daily events, summarizing distinct interactions into long-term beliefs.

### 🌍 The World (The "Stage")
*   **Spatial Context:** A fully interactive 2D grid. Agents must physically be near each other to talk.
*   **Object Affordance:** Agents recognize objects (beds, desks, coffee machines) as tools to satisfy physiological needs.
*   **Dynamic Economy:** Agents can trade items, services, or information using a scarcity-based token system.

### ⚡ God Mode (Player Interaction)
*   **The Whisper Mechanic:** Insert a specific thought into an agent's internal monologue (e.g., *"You suspect Alice is lying to you"*) and watch the chaos unfold.
*   **World Manipulation:** Trigger weather events, lock doors, or spawn resources to force social cooperation or conflict.
*   **Interrogation:** Pause time and query an agent's reasoning engine to understand *why* they performed a specific action.
